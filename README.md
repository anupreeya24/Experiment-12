# **Theory:**

Constructors and destructors are special member functions in object-oriented programming that handle the initialization and cleanup of objects, respectively. A constructor is automatically invoked when an object is created and is used to set initial values and allocate resources. A destructor is automatically called when an object is destroyed, serving to release resources and perform any necessary cleanup tasks. Implementing constructors and destructors effectively ensures that resources are managed correctly and that objects are in a valid state throughout their lifecycle.

# **Conclusion:**

Studying and implementing constructors and destructors provides a foundational understanding of resource management in object-oriented programming. Constructors enable proper initialization, while destructors ensure that resources are freed appropriately. Proper implementation of these functions enhances program stability, prevents memory leaks, and supports efficient resource management, contributing to more robust and maintainable code.
